Goal: Enterprise level lab for Security Testing
Milestones:
1. Setup services on Dell PowerEdge R710 to emulate a router to the network
2. Setup LXD containers with intentionally vulnerable OSes
3. Setup Network Equipment Lab
4. Congfigure admin portal on the Dell PowerEdge R710 to allow ssh to network equipment
5. Network equipment 'states' - preconfigured network environments

See the following Diagram for a representation of the network:

The devices will provide the following functions:
The Firewall will Tunnel through my home network to the Internet. 
	The tunnel endpoint will most likely be a VDS, to preserve my own security.
The Core Devices will maintain the real backend of the entire environment, and guarentee access to all devices.
The Lab Devices will have dynamically applied configs (with exception of Loopback) as needed
The Server will have multiple connections for distinct services:
	Management VLAN/Network (maybe even VRF) for personal maintainance
	User Portal to announce the current challenge and provide resources to defeat it.
	pfSense connection that will connect the Vulnerable OS Containers to the Lab Network.
		If possible I'd like to to represent these to the network as if they're real connections on the switch.

While the link functions will be:
The Management connections will ride the 'Core RTR -- Lab RTR' link.
The 'Core SVR -- Lab SW2' link will be used for transient connections.
The rest of the connections will act as normal 802.1q tagged links.

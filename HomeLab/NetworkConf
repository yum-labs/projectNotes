Network Configuration:
I think the most effective way to connect and configure the network equipment will be to use Cisco VIRL. 
This should make it possible to manage the virtualized network equipment automatically, by using the VIRL RESTful APIs.
Ideally it should be possible the network virtual machines are deployed with bugs and vulnerabilities.

VIRL can support up to 10 Virtual Devices and can be connected to actual network equipment.
